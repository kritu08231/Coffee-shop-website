I created a responsive dummy coffee shop website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project includes several modules:

Homepage – Displays an image of the coffee.
About Page – Provides information about the coffee shop.
Menu Page – Showcases the coffee shop's menu.
Testimonials Page – Features customer reviews. we can see our customer reviews.
Gallery Page – Displays images of the coffee shop and its menu items.
Contact Page – Provides contact details for the coffee shop and also here we can fill the feedback form about our coffee shop experience.
